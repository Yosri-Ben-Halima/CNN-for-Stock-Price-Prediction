# CNN-for-Stock-Price-Prediction
In this project, I develop a CNN-based tool for stock price modeling and forecasting. This repository covers data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, including callbacks like Early Stopping and Learning Rate Reduction. Ideal for quantitative finance, the project emphasizes model evaluation and accurate stock price predictions.
